About Me
<ul>
<li> Hi! Welcome to the world of Quynh, that's me! I am only 5 feet tall but I have a big personality, probably due to my ADHD. I like to describe myself as a cranky edlerly woman in a 28 year old body. I am also living with a 20 pounnd cat that I am allergic to! I am fluent in both Vietnamsese and English, and I am ready for this coding adventure! </li>
</ul>

Past Coding Experience
<ul>
<li> I do not have ANY coding experience because I have spent about a decade of my life working in healthcare. Everyone around me was encouraging me to pursue heatlhcare, but as of three years ago, I decided to change my life and go after what makes me happy! </li>
</ul>

Career Goals
<ol>
    <li> I want to learn as much as I can and I want to always keep learning. </li>
    <li> I want to hopefully find a job that allows me to have the opportunities for grow in whatever career I end up with, and to enjoy that career. </li>
    <li> I would love it if my career gives me the opportunity to integrate my knowledge from both coding and another field such as healthcare or ADHD. </li>
    <li> My goals change often depending on the situation and the opportunities given, so these goals are not concrete, but whatever my career goals end up being after the program, I genuinely hope that I will be able to do my best in them. </li>
</ol>
